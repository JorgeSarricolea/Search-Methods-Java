In this repository you can find the different types of search methods with an example of each one programmed in Java.

## Description
Search methods play a crucial role in data structures as they allow efficient retrieval of data based on specific criteria. Here are some key points highlighting the importance of search methods in data structures:

Efficient Retrieval: Search methods enable efficient retrieval of data from data structures. They provide a way to locate and access specific elements, minimizing the time and effort required to find the desired data.

Data Organization: Search methods help in organizing data in a structured manner within data structures. By using appropriate search methods, data can be sorted, indexed, or hashed, allowing for faster and more efficient retrieval.

Time Complexity: Different search methods have varying time complexities. Choosing an appropriate search method based on the characteristics of the data and the requirements of the application can greatly impact the efficiency of data retrieval. Methods like binary search and hash search provide faster retrieval times compared to sequential search, particularly for large datasets.

Performance Optimization: By utilizing efficient search methods, data structures can optimize performance. For example, in a database system, the choice of an appropriate search method can significantly impact the response time of queries and operations.

Data Integrity: Search methods are often used in data structures to ensure data integrity and consistency. For instance, in a binary search tree, the search method is used to maintain the sorted order of elements, allowing for efficient searching as well as maintaining the integrity of the structure.

Algorithm Design and Analysis: Understanding different search methods is essential for algorithm design and analysis. It helps in selecting the most suitable search algorithm based on the requirements of the problem at hand, leading to optimized and efficient solutions.

Application Development: Search methods are fundamental to various applications and systems. From databases and information retrieval systems to search engines and recommendation systems, efficient search methods are critical for enabling fast and accurate data retrieval.

### Sequential Search
Sequential search, also known as linear search, is a simple and straightforward algorithm for searching an element within a collection of data. It sequentially checks each element of the collection until the desired element is found or the end of the collection is reached. It is typically used when the data is unordered or not sorted.

Here are some key points about sequential search:

Algorithm Steps:

1. Start from the first element of the collection. Compare each element with the target element.
If a match is found, return the index or position of the element.
If the entire collection is traversed without finding a match, return a sentinel value (e.g., -1) to indicate that the target element is not present.

2. Suitable Data Structures: Sequential search can be applied to various data structures, including arrays, linked lists, and other linear data structures. It does not require any specific ordering or structure of the data.

3. Time Complexity: The time complexity of sequential search is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the collection. In the worst case, when the target element is at the end of the collection or is not present at all, the algorithm will compare each element with the target, resulting in n comparisons.

### Binary Search
Binary search is an efficient search algorithm used to find a specific element in a sorted collection of data. It operates by repeatedly dividing the search space in half, discarding the half that does not contain the target element. It is commonly used for large datasets or arrays where the data is sorted.

Here are some key points about binary search:

Prerequisite: Binary search requires the data to be sorted in ascending or descending order before performing the search. This ensures that the algorithm can make informed decisions about which half of the search space to discard at each step.

Algorithm Steps:

1. Compare the target element with the middle element of the current search space.
If the target element matches the middle element, the search is successful, and the position or index of the element is returned.
If the target element is smaller than the middle element, repeat the search on the left half of the current search space.
If the target element is larger than the middle element, repeat the search on the right half of the current search space.

2. Continue this process of dividing the search space in half until the target element is found or the search space is empty.

3. Time Complexity: Binary search has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the collection. The search space is effectively halved at each step, resulting in significantly fewer comparisons compared to sequential search (O(n)). This makes binary search much more efficient for larger datasets.

### Hash Search
Hash search, also known as hash table lookup, is a search method that utilizes a hash function and a data structure called a hash table. It provides fast and efficient access to data by mapping keys to specific locations within the table. Hash search is particularly useful for scenarios where quick retrieval of data based on unique keys is required.

Here are some key points about hash search:

1. Hash Function: Hash search relies on a hash function that takes a key as input and computes a hash value. The hash value is used to determine the index or location within the hash table where the corresponding data is stored.

2. Hash Table: A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. It consists of an array of slots or buckets, where each slot can hold multiple elements or is associated with a linked list or other data structure to handle collisions.

3. Key-Value Mapping: In hash search, the key is used to generate the hash value, which is then used to find the corresponding location within the hash table. The value associated with the key can be quickly retrieved from that location.

4. Fast Retrieval: Hash search provides constant-time complexity for search, insert, and delete operations on average. This means that regardless of the size of the dataset, the time required to perform these operations remains relatively constant.
